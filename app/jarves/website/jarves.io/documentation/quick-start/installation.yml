            # Installation
            
            This describes the customized installation, usually used by developers.
            
            A end-user zip package can be downloaded at http://jarves.io when we've released the first alpha version.
            
            ## Jarves Standard

            The easiest way yet is to install [github.com/jarves/jarves-standard](https://github.com/jarves/jarves-standard).
            See readme for the setup introduction.
            
            ## Custom installation
            
            If you want to go the hard way, so can install symfony and add Jarves on your own. This is
            also the introduction you should follow when you have already a Symfony application and
            want to add Jarves additional to it.
            
            ### 1. [Install Symfony](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/installation.html) (v3.*)
            
            ```html
            composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition website-with-jarves
            ```
            
            ### 2.1 Install the Jarves bundles for development/testing

            Remove in `composer.json` the `config.platform.php` settings (latest lines).
            Add in `composer.json`

            ```
            {
                ...
                 "minimum-stability": "dev",
                 "prefer-stable": true,
            }
            ```
            
            Use `"symfony-assets-install": "symlink"` if your system supports symlinks.

            ```bash
            cd website-with-jarves
            composer require jarves/jarves:dev-master
            composer require jarves/publication-bundle:dev-master
            composer require jarves/demotheme-bundle:dev-master
            ```
            
            ### 2.2 Install some dependencies
            
            #### SCSS
            
            http://sass-lang.com/install
            
            1. osx: `sudo gem install sass`
            2. linux: `sudo su -c "gem install sass"`
            3. windows: see http://sass-lang.com/install

            ## Configure Symfony 

            Activate the bundle in your AppKernel:
            
            ```php
            <?php
            // app/AppKernel.php
            
            public function registerBundles()
            {
                $bundles = array(
                    // ...
            
            
                    // our dependencies - it's important that these come before Jarves
                    new Propel\Bundle\PropelBundle\PropelBundle(),
                    new FOS\RestBundle\FOSRestBundle(),
                    new Nelmio\ApiDocBundle\NelmioApiDocBundle(),
            
                    // Jarves
                    new Jarves\JarvesBundle(),
                    new Jarves\DemoTheme\JarvesDemoThemeBundle(),
                    new Jarves\Publication\JarvesPublicationBundle(),
                );
            }
            ```
            
            ### 3. Configurate database settings

            Use `php bin/console jarves:configuration:database --help` to see how you can change the database settings.

            You can alternatively go the regular Symfony way and just change `app/config/parameters.yml`
            (`jarves:configuration:database` is changing that file anyways)

            Make sure Propel ORM is configured in your `app/config/config.yml`.

            ```yml
            propel:
                database:
                    connections:
                        default:
                            adapter:    "%database_driver%"
                            user:       "%database_user%"
                            password:   "%database_password%"
                            dsn:        "%database_driver%:host=%database_host%;dbname=%database_name%"
            ```


            ### 4. Setup models and database schema
            
            ```bash
            php bin/console propel:model:build #build base model
            
            php bin/console propel:migration:diff #generates a database schema diff
            php bin/console propel:migration:up #upgrade the database schema
            
            ### Installs demo data
            
            php bin/console jarves:install:demo 127.0.0.1 /
            
            ```
            
            ### 5. Setup the administration route. Open `app/config/routing.yml` and paste this route:
            
            ```yml
            jarves:
                resource: "@JarvesBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
            ```
            
            ### 6. Verify
            
            run
            
            ```bash
            php bin/console server:run
            # open http://127.0.0.1:8000/jarves
            ```
            
            Username and password for the administration login (http://127.0.0.1:8000/jarves) is both `admin`.
            
            REST API doc powered by NelmioApiBundle is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/jarves/api.
            
            The frontend routes are loaded automatically.

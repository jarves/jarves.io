           - Session storage through several layers (distributed sessions supported)
           - Easy to extend through a fancy extension editor, completely modulized - the symfony way
           - CRUD window generator, without writing one line of code
           - Easy and integrated backup system, perfect for live/dev-scenarios
           - Extremely detailed permission system
           - Ships with a solid bunch of UI input widgets (input fields)
           - Several flexible authentication layers (e.g. changeable for administration, changeable per domain)
           - Secure password storage using up-to-date encryptions
           - Feature-rich inline editing (TinyMCE, Markdown, Drag'n'Drop', etc)
